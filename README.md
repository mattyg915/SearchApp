## Install

Clone this repository down to your machine. Make sure you have yarn and node installed. The easiest way to install both on a mac is to use homebrew. Run `brew install node` and `brew install yarn` from the terminal. To install homebrew on a mac, run `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` from your terminal. Once these pre-requisites are installed, run:

### `yarn install`

... from the search-app directory to install all needed application dependencies.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn start`

Builds the app to the `build` folder.
Then launches the app in your default browser. If it does not launch automatically, the app can be reached at http://localhost:3000
